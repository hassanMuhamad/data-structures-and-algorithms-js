# Introduction

My journey between different programming languages, made me curious about implementing data structures and their associated algorithms.

This corner of every programming language is abandoned nowadays. It cannot be doubted that it affects the level of the existing programmers. Programmers who know how to implement data structures and algorithms are able to solve problems in a more efficient way.

Isn't the dream? writing a professional piece of art to solve a problem instead of the old absurd way.

Its not a shame if did so before. We are geeks, we keep learning and improving ourselves.

After finishing this collection, you will have a better vision of what are the different data structures available in JavaScript and how to use them in your code when possible.
