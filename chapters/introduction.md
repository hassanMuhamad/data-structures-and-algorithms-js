# Introduction

My journey between different programming languages, made me curious about implementing data structures and their associated algorithms.

This corner of every programming language is abandoned nowadays. It cannot be doubted that it affects the level of the existing programmers. Programmers who know how to implement data structures and algorithms are able to solve problems in a more efficient way.

> Isn't the dream? writing a professional piece of art to solve a problem instead of the old absurd way.

Its not a shame if did so before. We are geeks, we keep learning and improving ourselves.

After finishing this collection, you will have a better vision of what are the different data structures available in JavaScript and how to use them in your code when possible.

## Why Data Structures and Abstract Data Types?

Haven't you worked on solving a problem and suddenly you found yourself lost in the details?

Abstract data type — shortly known as ADT, is the key for such situations. It is a logical description of our vision of the data and what operations are allowed, without focusing on how it will be implemented.

By doing so, we are separate the implementation from our vision. We call this information hiding which allows us to remain fully focused on solving the problem.

## Why Algorithms?

As what I've said before, we — programmers, essentially learn either by solving problems or studying an existing solution.

Understanding how algorithms are made, will without doubt help us to take our problem solving skills to the next level.

Let's take computing a square root as an example. If I ask 10 programmers to write a solution. I can easily have 10 different implementations. So we need to have a knowledge to be able to compare these solution in terms of time and resource consumption. This can be gained by studying algorithms.

Did you know what is worst? the inability to distinguish between solvable problems and these that can not be solved in a realistic amount of time.

so are you still not betting on studying algorithms?
